# chaseng.me

This is the source code for https://chaseng.me

A very simple personal homepage for Chase.

He is currently 3 years old and loves cars and trucks.

The site is intentionally minimal.

## Tech Stack

- Static HTML
- Deployed with Cloudflare Pages
- Custom domain: chaseng.me
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/itschaseng/chaseng.me

No frameworks.
No build step.
No analytics.
No tracking.

Just a single `index.html`.

## Deployment

This site is deployed using **Cloudflare Pages**.

### Setup

1. The repository is connected to Cloudflare Pages.
2. Production branch: `main`
3. Build command: _(none)_
4. Build output directory: `/`

Because this is a plain static site, Cloudflare serves the files directly.

Every push to `main` automatically triggers a new deployment.

## Domain

- DNS managed by Cloudflare
- `chaseng.me` is connected to the Cloudflare Pages project

## Philosophy

This site is intentionally simple.

It exists as:
- A small piece of digital real estate
- A time capsule
- A place that can grow over time

Right now, it says:

> Hi, I’m Chase.  
> I love cars and trucks.

That’s enough.
